##What I Learned

#1) The purpose of this github repository is twofold. First of all, it creates a place where all of our old assignments are stored, so when we do any sort of project in the future we can look back at this as an example. Second, it provides us with a private GitHub repository that we can use to do work in the future without other people being able to see it.

#2) My favorite assignment was Assignment 2, even though it caused lots of frustration and took more time than I would have liked. I really enjoyed the finished product. I never thought, going into this class with minimal web experience, that by the second assignment I would be able to use the Google Maps API and call upon a server to use real-time data in a format like that.

#3) I think I have grown immensely from day 1 of the course to now. I have gone from knowing only minimal HTML and CSS to being able to produce a finished project from beginning to end. I have also grown in programming maturity, as all I had done before was very linear and object-oriented.

#4) The two most important things I have learned in this course are the application of data structures and AJAX/first-class-functions. For the data structures part, we learned stacks and hashes in Comp 20 before we did them in Comp 15. When we got to them in 15 they were more accessible because I had already used them and I had already seen just how well they worked. As for the AJAX/first-class-functions, this was the first course that I have taken where the language didn't move linearly with clearly-defined functions and objects. Although this gave me a bit of trouble (see time taken on assignment 3), I feel that when I take 105 and other higher-level classes I will be used to callbacks and the concept of asynchronous programming.

#5) I was most interested in front-end JavaScript and its applications, so I will continue trying to learn more about that.
