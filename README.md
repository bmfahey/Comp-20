This class taught me basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and databases in
order to make websites. The websites created were supposed to be
responsive and mobile. This class taught many broad topics such as 
the file transfer protocol, how the Web works, and why websites 
need to be as lightweight as possible. We also learned how the 
client's browser interacts with a server and how that server 
interacts with a database, creating a nontrivial website. 

Some specific technologies learned include:

- HTML 5 and the DOM

- CSS and Bootstrap

- Javascript / Ajax

- MongoDB

Some basic security was also learned, including cross-site 
scripting, database injection, and more. 

At the end of this class, a large website was created with a group
of peers. This website can be accessed at http://not-so-jumbo.herokuapp.com.
