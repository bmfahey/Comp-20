Assignment 2
Landmarks
Javascript and Google Maps API

1) All aspects of this prject have been implemented correctly. Although it is not a part of the project description, I would like to remove 
		the polyline when the user clicks somewhere else but was unable to implement that.

2) I did not collaborate with any classmates on this assignment. However, I used Stack Overflow when I was having issues. I especially used
		it for the Haversine Formula implementation. I used example code from Ming as a basis for starting the assignment. And, of course
		I used Google's API documentation extensively.

3) I spent approximately 11 hours on this assignment.
