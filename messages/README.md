JSON Parsing

1. All aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly.

2. I did not work with anyone on this assignment. I did research on Stack Overflow to find out how to only make the background color go behind the text (using the div) and how to curve the borders. 

3. I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.

Question: The file will not work when opened with index.html. It throws an error because this violates the same-origin policy of JavaScript. If I could read/write to files on my own computer or even other servers, web security would be extremely comprimised. I could fill up my entire computer with data. Sites could access each other if both were open on my computer by getting access to each others' JavaScript. This is why the same-origin policy exists.
