    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This product is a geolocation-based web application. It uses Heroku,
        MongoDB, and the Google Maps API to display the location of users that
        have logged on and the nearest historical landmarks to the person
        currently logged on. There are also interfaces for getting all the
        logons for a certain user and for getting all logons of all the users
        in the database. This product was written by Joe Kamibeppu in fulfillemt
        of Assignments 2 and 3 in COMP20 Spring 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this document is to find security vulnerabilities present
        in this product. It will present evidence of said vulnerabilities, discuss
        the potential risks, and suggest ways the product could be improved to
        help prevent these risks from becoming realities.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Methodology:</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I tried to think of the security vulnerabilities before even looking at
        the code provided to me. I did research about how to take advatnage of
        vulnerabilities that I thought might exist, such as the syntax for greater
        than in MongoDB I tested my theories, and they worked. Then I
        looked at the code to determine exactly where the lines were that caused
        the issues. After that I did research to determine the best way to fix
        them, depending on the problem. Finally, I determined the expected costs
        or downfalls of applying these fixes.
    <p>
        I did not use any special tools to find any of these security vulnerabilities.
        For the cross site scripting I used curl. For the Mongo injection I used
        Google Chrome, because it only involved typing into the URL bar. Finally,
        for the database and server overload, I used curl again as well as a
        script I wrote myself.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings:</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The first two security issues found with this product deal with user input.
        In the first one, the server assumes that the user is inputting the three
        fields it is looking for. In fact, the user could be sending any sort of
        data. This data could include malicious code that would harm the product.
        The second vulnerability discovered with the product is, again, with what gets
        sent to the server by the client. The client has the ability to send
        a command that will make the page display all the information from the
        other users, a privacy risk considering this information contains the
        location from which they last logged in. Finally, the last issue deals
        with the way new users are handled. First of all, everytime a user submits
        data it is stored alongside the old data, instead of replacing it. Second,
        the database has a somewhat limited storage which could be completely filled
        in a malicious attack.
    </p>

    <h2>Issues Found:</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Issue 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                Issue: Through Cross-Site Scripting, attackers can insert or delete
                almost anything they want, especially if they know the setup of the
                server.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Location: I was able to POST the malicious data through the
                /sendLocation route, but the issue manifests itself when anyone
                accesses the index page of the server, where it is supposed to
                display all the logins.
            </p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Severity of issue: <span style="color:red">High</span></p>
                <p>Using XSS, an attacker could do almost anything. In fact, my
                proof of concept shows one of the worst case-scenarios. Using a
                simple (one-line) curl request, I was able to force the '/' route
                to redirect to a website, Google. While redirecting to a search
                engine is harmles, this proves that someone truly malicious could
                do much more. Using redirection and a GET or POST request, an
                attacker could redirect to another page and populate it to look
                exactly like the page the user was on. However, the attacker's
                page would most likely include some sort of form that would ask
                the unknowing user for personal information like passwords. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>
                Description of issue: The POST route '/sendLocation' does not have
                any data sanitization. Although I was simply able to look at the
                code to spot this, it would not be difficult for an attacker to
                just try POSTing some malicious content to see if it would work.
                Below is the offending code:
                <br>
                <br>
                <code> var login = request.body.login; <br> var toInsert = {
        			"login"		: login, ...}; </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                One can clearly see that the login is not checked at all before
                it is inserted into the database.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Proof of vulnerability: I used the following command in curl:
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src = "./images/curl1.png" alt = "curl command">
                <br>
                <br>
                This redirects the '/' path immediately when the user goes to it. <br>
                Here is the page in the second or so before it loads and redirects:
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src = "./images/redirection.png" alt = "redirection" class = "screenshot">
                <br>
                <br>
                After this the page redirects to Google, but a hacker could redirect
                it to any site he/she wanted and steal information.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The resolution for this vulnerability can be reasonably simple.
                All that must be done is some data sanitization. An example of this
                could be using regular expressions, like so:
                <br>
                <br>
                <code> login = login.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                This can be done for the other fields as well.
            </p></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <h3>Issue 2: MongoDB Injection</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    Issue: MongoDB has a vulnerability in which special characters
                    can be used for things like less than and greater than, and
                    used maliciously this can give away passwords and other private
                    information.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Location: This risk lies in the '/checkins.json' route, inside
                    the file "index.js."
                </p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Severity of issue: <span style="color:orangered">Medium</span></p>
                    <p>This issue is mostly bad for this specific product because
                    it allows someone to see location data for other users, information
                    that should definitely be kept private. However, this database
                    contains anonymized data and no passwords or financial information.
                    Also, the locations are not real-time. So, although this problem
                    must be fixed to protect the privacy of users, it is not as
                    urgent as the XSS vulnerability.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                    Description of issue: In MongoDB, the phrase "[$gt]" means
                    "greater than." This phrase can be used as part of the Mongo
                    "find" command to find all objects with a value for a key greater
                    than that specified. The following code shows this command in
                    use in the file index.js:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code> coll.find({"login" : login}).toArray(function(error, myLogs) </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This query finds all the documents in the collection that have
                    the value of the variable login for the key "login." However,
                    submitting a query for a value greater than undefined will
                    return every single document in the database (assuming there
                    are no users with an undefined login).
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Proof of vulnerability: One can simply type the following into his or her address bar in a modern browser:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code> https://quiet-depths-13570.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$gt]=</code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This tells Mongo to find all documents with a login greater than undefined. Because this describes all legitimate
                    users in the database, the site returns and displays all of the users. <br>
                    These are screenshots of the page when functioning correctly (to display a user) and when the vulnerability is exposed:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src = "./images/checkins-working.png" alt = "working checkins" border = "2px">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src = "./images/checkins-broken.png" alt = "broken checkins" class = "screenshot">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    The resolution for this vulnerability is, again, fairly simple.
                    One should simply check to make sure that the field for login
                    is not undefined. If it is it should return some sort of error
                    message.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code> if (!(login)) {
                        <br>
                		response.send("Please enter a login!");
                        <br>
                	} </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This will not allow a comparison to undefined.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Issue 3: Overloading the Server and Mongo</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    Issue: There is nothing checking how much the server can handle,
                    and the size of the Mongo database being used is limited. Thus,
                    an attacker can overload the server with enough requests to
                    both slow down the server and eventually fill up the limited
                    database.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Location: The 'sendLocation' route is used to POST data over
                    and over again. This route is located in index.js. The evidence
                    of this vulnerability can also be seen if you go to the
                    'checkins.json' page for a login id that was used to spam the
                    server.
                </p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Severity of issue: <span style="color:orange">Low</span></p>
                    <p> This issue exists, but compared to the other issues present
                    it is fairly negligible. The most that will happen is that
                    a hacker will fill up the whole Mongo SandBox database, but
                    even this takes a fair amount of time.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                    Description of issue: This issue is twofold. First, there is
                    nothing in place to stop requests from spamming the server. Thus,
                    someone could continually POST more and more data. This leads
                    to the second issue. If data is continually POSTed to the server
                    and continually added to the database without any checks,
                    the server may eventually fill up. This will happen because
                    the Mongo SandBox server being used is only 500MB large. Below
                    is the currently faulty code that will accept any number of
                    requests and add them all to the database:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code> coll.insert(toInsert, function(error, saved) </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This code, from line 70 of index.js, does not check anything
                    about the data being submitted, such as whether the user already
                    exists or not.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Proof of vulnerability: I wrote the following shell script:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src = "./images/bash.png" alt = "my bash script" border = "2px">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This script sends an infinite number of POST requests, over and over, to the server (the data means nothing). <br>
                    This is the checkins page for the user "i", the one that I was spamming with:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src = "./images/overload.png" alt = "overloaded page" class = "screenshot">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After running my script for about an hour, the size of the
                    HTML file that gets returned is about 500KB in size. The limit
                    for this version of Mongo is 500MB. That means that it would
                    take 100 hours for the server to completely fill up and cause
                    an issue, at least from my computer. This is part of the reason
                    that the risk was deemed "low."
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    The resolution for this vulnerability is to find out whether
                    the user already exists before attempting to add them, like so:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code> coll.update({"login":login}:$set{"lat":lat, "lng":lng}) </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Upsert" can be set to true if a new user should be made if
                    the one in the query is not found.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Through simply checking the data that a user sends to the server, the
        functionality, security, and privacy of the entire product can be improved.
        Currently, Cross-Site Scripting leaves the site open to attack, flaws
        in the database pose a risk to the privacy of all its users, and a somewhat
        small databse can be filled up by a hacker, especially with the current implementation
        of the user storage system. By sanitizing input many of these risks would be
        avoided at no cost. The only fix that would require money is the larger
        database, which can be purchased for as little as $15 from Mongo, although
        the most permanent solution would be an unlimited database, which would cost
        $180.
