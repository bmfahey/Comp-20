        This product is a geolocation-based web application. It uses Heroku,
        MongoDB, and the Google Maps API to display the location of users that
        have logged on and the nearest historical landmarks to the person
        currently logged on. There are also interfaces for getting all the
        logons for a certain user and for getting all logons of all the users
        in the database. This product was written by Joe Kamibeppu in fulfillemt
        of Assignments 2 and 3 in COMP20 Spring 2016.
